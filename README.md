SDI Pokedex
Create a pokedex single page app using React Hooks and create-react-app. Please use the pokemon API  we have seen throughout the class.
Use the following user stories to guide your development:


1.As a user, I should be able to navigate to the home page and see a list of all the pokemon (at least the first 151), including their pictures, so that I can review the pokemon.

2.As a user I should be able to click on a pokemon’s picture that directs me to a web page that provides additional information about that pokemon, so that I can learn more about an individual pokemon.

3.As a user I should be able to navigate to an about page from any other page, so that I can read information about the team that developed this Pokedex application.

4.As a user when I am in the pokedex page that lists the pokemon, I should be able to use a dropdown box to filter the pokemon by their types, so that I can identify the pokemon of a particular type.

5.As a user, when I am viewing an individual pokemon, I should be presented with a panel that defaults to showing me their abilities, so that I can see their abilities.

6.As a user, I should be able to click an “environment” link/button from inside the individual pokemon page that changes the panel from abilities to information about that pokemon’s environment.

Routing Specific Stories
Use React Router to continue work on your SDI Pokedex, using the following stories to guide your development:

1. As a user, I should be able to click an “environment” link/button from inside the individual pokemon page that changes the panel from abilities to information about that pokemon’s environment.

2. As a user, when I navigate to the relative path “/pokemon/bulbasaur/environment”, I should land on a page that navigates to the individual pokemon page that specifically shows the environment in the information panel so that I can bookmark environment information for each pokemon.

3. As a user, I want to be able to leverage my browser's history capability to go forward and backward from the various routes in the SDI Pokedex.
