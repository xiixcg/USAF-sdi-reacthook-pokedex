SDI Pokedex
Create a pokedex single page app using React Hooks and create-react-app. Please use the pokemon API  we have seen throughout the class.
Use the following user stories to guide your development:


1.As a user, I should be able to navigate to the home page and see a list of all the pokemon (at least the first 151), including their pictures, so that I can review the pokemon.

2.As a user I should be able to click on a pokemon’s picture that directs me to a web page that provides additional information about that pokemon, so that I can learn more about an individual pokemon.

3.As a user I should be able to navigate to an about page from any other page, so that I can read information about the team that developed this Pokedex application.

4.As a user when I am in the pokedex page that lists the pokemon, I should be able to use a dropdown box to filter the pokemon by their types, so that I can identify the pokemon of a particular type.

5.As a user, when I am viewing an individual pokemon, I should be presented with a panel that defaults to showing me their abilities, so that I can see their abilities.

6.As a user, I should be able to click an “environment” link/button from inside the individual pokemon page that changes the panel from abilities to information about that pokemon’s environment.
